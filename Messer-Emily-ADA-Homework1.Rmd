## Challenge 1

```{r }
d <- ("There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved")

library(stringr)
```

## Challenge 2

```{r }
m <- 1:159
m <- m[seq(from = 1, to = 159, by = 2)]
m

m1 <- matrix(
  data = c(m),
  nrow = 8,
  ncol = 10
  )
m1

(m1[5,2])
(m1[5:7,])

m2 <- (m1[3:6, 4:9])
m2
class(m2)
mode(m2)
```

## Challenge 3

```{r }
a <-array(data = 400:1, dim = c(5, 5, 4, 4))
a
(a[1, 1, 1, 2]) ## not sure about this answer...
(a[2, 3, 2, ])
(a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3])
```

## Challenge 4
